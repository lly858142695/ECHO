# ECHO Next EQ

ECHO Next EQ is a playable HiFi DSP feature. It is intentionally transparent about the signal path: enabling EQ disables bit-perfect output, even when the selected device path is WASAPI Exclusive or ASIO.

## Phase 1 Scope

- 10-band graphic/parametric hybrid EQ
- fixed band Q, currently `1.0`
- draggable band center frequency from `20 Hz` to `20 kHz`
- preamp from `-12 dB` to `+6 dB`
- band gain from `-12 dB` to `+12 dB`
- enable/bypass
- built-in and user presets
- curve visualization
- spectrum analyzer placeholder and native hook point
- clipping/headroom warning

Default band frequencies:

```text
31 Hz, 62 Hz, 125 Hz, 250 Hz, 500 Hz, 1 kHz, 2 kHz, 4 kHz, 8 kHz, 16 kHz
```

## Bit-Perfect Rules

EQ enabled:

- `eqEnabled = true`
- `dspActive = true`
- `bitPerfectCandidate = false`
- `bitPerfectDisabledReason = eq_enabled`
- UI shows that output is not bit-perfect

EQ disabled/bypassed:

- native output crossfades back to the dry signal
- EQ must not alter audio once bypass smoothing reaches zero
- `bitPerfectCandidate` may recover if no other DSP, resampling, or output mismatch is active

Flat preset is not the same concept as disabled. Flat has `0 dB` bands and `0 dB` preamp, but if EQ remains enabled the signal path still passes through DSP and is not bit-perfect.

## Native DSP Structure

Native files:

- `native/audio-engine/EqTypes.h`
- `native/audio-engine/EqBand.h`
- `native/audio-engine/EqProcessor.h`
- `native/audio-engine/EqProcessor.cpp`
- `native/audio-engine/EqPresetStore.h`
- `native/audio-engine/EqPresetStore.cpp`
- `native/audio-engine/EqMessageProtocol.h`
- `native/audio-engine/EqMessageProtocol.cpp`

`EqProcessor` is the realtime component. It owns per-channel biquad state, atomic target parameters, preamp smoothing, band gain smoothing, bypass crossfade, and clipping risk detection.
Band gain and center frequency are both atomic targets. Frequency movement is smoothed before coefficients are recalculated, so horizontal curve dragging does not require locks or UI access inside the callback.

`EqMessageProtocol` parses JSON-line control messages outside the audio callback and updates atomic targets. The PCM stream remains on stdin; realtime EQ commands use a localhost JSON-line control socket so control traffic never mixes with audio bytes.

## Realtime-Safe Rules

The JUCE callback must not:

- allocate large objects
- read or write JSON
- access Electron, React, IPC handlers, or UI state
- wait on a mutex
- perform preset file IO

Parameter updates must:

- clamp invalid values
- use atomic target values
- smooth gain/preamp changes over roughly `25 ms`
- crossfade bypass over roughly `15 ms`
- avoid NaN output during rapid parameter changes
- avoid recomputing all band coefficients every sample once gain/frequency smoothing has reached a steady target

## Electron Bridge

Renderer components use `window.echo.eq` only. The renderer never touches audio buffers.

Commands:

- `eq:get-state`
- `eq:set-enabled`
- `eq:set-band-gain`
- `eq:set-band-frequency`
- `eq:set-preamp`
- `eq:set-preset`
- `eq:reset`
- `eq:list-presets`
- `eq:save-preset`
- `eq:import-preset`
- `eq:export-preset`
- `eq:delete-preset`

Example native control request:

```json
{ "type": "eq:set-band-gain", "band": 3, "gainDb": 2.5 }
```

```json
{ "type": "eq:set-band-frequency", "band": 3, "frequencyHz": 360 }
```

Example event/state response:

```json
{
  "type": "eq:state",
  "enabled": true,
  "preampDb": -3,
  "bands": [{ "frequencyHz": 31, "gainDb": 0, "q": 1 }]
}
```

## Preset Format

```json
{
  "id": "bass-boost",
  "name": "Bass Boost",
  "preampDb": -2,
  "bands": [
    { "frequencyHz": 31, "gainDb": 4, "q": 1 }
  ],
  "createdAt": "built-in",
  "updatedAt": "built-in",
  "readonly": true
}
```

Built-in presets:

- Flat
- Bass Boost
- Vocal Clear
- Treble Sparkle
- Loudness
- Night
- Headphone Warm
- Anime / J-Pop
- Rock
- Classical

`Flat` is readonly. User presets are stored as JSON under Electron `userData`, validated on load, and rejected if malformed.
Imported presets are saved with a fresh id when a built-in or user preset already has the same id, so importing a shared preset never silently overwrites a local tuning.

## UI Structure

`EqPanel` contains:

- enable/bypass switch
- preset selector
- reset
- EQ curve view
- analyzer placeholder
- preamp slider
- draggable curve nodes for gain and frequency
- precision controls for selected band frequency, gain, Q, filter type, channel link, and phase mode
- bit-perfect/headroom warning
- preset save/delete controls

Curve movement is throttled while dragging, with accurate gain and frequency values sent on release.

## Stability Acceptance

EQ correctness is covered by both TypeScript bridge/UI tests and native audio-engine tests.

Native test entrypoint:

```text
npm run test:audio-engine
```

Native DSP tests must verify:

- disabled EQ returns the dry input exactly
- Flat preset with EQ enabled stays numerically transparent while still reporting DSP active through app status
- high-gain EQ returns to dry output after bypass crossfade completes
- rapid gain, frequency, and preamp changes never output NaN or Inf
- frequency clamps remain stable at and beyond `20 Hz` and `20 kHz`
- steady-state processing does not keep recalculating all 10 biquad coefficients every sample

Existing Electron/renderer tests must continue to verify:

- `EqBridge` validation, preset persistence, and channel-balance clamping
- EQ UI controls, curve editing, undo/redo, A/B slots, and preset actions
- audio status bit-perfect disabling when EQ or channel balance is active
- headroom and clipping-risk telemetry

## Later Scope

- full parametric bands
- realtime analyzer
- dynamic EQ
- auto gain
- A/B compare persistence
- per-output profile
- per-headphone profile

Not in scope:

- VST host
- convolution or room correction
- AutoEQ database
- network preset marketplace
- lyrics/MV/streaming coupling
